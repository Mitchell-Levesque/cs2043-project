# cs2043-project
Final project for CS2043 

For some reason, "SEProject.jar" isn't launching properly for me on my laptop, but it works fine on my desktop.  I hope it works for you, but if you just have the source codes and run "GUI.java" it will execute the project correctly as well as long as "mysql-connector-java-8.0.13.jar" is linked to the project.

If there are any problems launching the program then please email me at mleves10@unb.ca, but there should be no problems.
